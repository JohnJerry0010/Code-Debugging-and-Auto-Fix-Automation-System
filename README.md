# Code-Debugging-and-Auto-Fix-Automation-System
This project uses AI to make finding and fixing bugs in code faster and smarter. It combines powerful models like CodeBERT to detect bugs and DeepSeek to suggest fixes. Instead of relying on manual debugging or rule-based tools, this system learns from real examples of code to understand and fix issues more accurately.
